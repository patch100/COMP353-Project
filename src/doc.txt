The problem with having cost as part of the order detail table is that it creates redundancy in the data. We want to avoid putting calculable values in tables because it wastes storage space. We already have the unit price in the product table so it is possible to calculate the cost by multiplying the price and the quantity. Also since cost is dependent on the price it doesnâ€™t really make sense to keep them separate. If for some reason, the price was changed and the order would have to be modified, we would have change the data from two fields instead of one. If we simply remove the cost from the order detail table we fix this redundancy.
